## Description
My project is titled the Zoo Keeping Project.    
Basically the project is a database of various zoo animals.<br>The website allows users to view information about the various animals.<br>The information users of my website can get incude:    
1. Name of animal
2. The latin-name of animal
3. The animal type e.g.mammal, birds, reptiles etc.
4. The minimum length of animal
5. the maximum length
6. The minimum weight 
7. The maximum weight
8. The lifespan of the animal.
9. The habitat of the animal
10. The diet of the animal.
11. The country of origin/geo-range  

Users can also donate towards  conservancy efforts. Donations start at KES1000.<br>One can also set free a given animal back to the wild. Users can also input outside data into the database.

The information stored in the database was obtained from a public free use API known as the [Zoo Animal](https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com/) API. I also increased interactivity of my website by using the local server.
